// Where_Do_External_Types_Come_From

//there are 4 space from there typescript's types comes from

//lib.d.ts => you can look while defining map and just go to its definition

//lib.dom.d.ts => default for dom

//projects that was in the ts that has their types

//project in js and has types and we install it by using @type/.... (so if project don't have their type due to js then people ship it)
